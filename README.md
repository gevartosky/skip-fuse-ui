# SkipFuseUI

Bridging between SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose for [native Skip](https://skip.tools/docs/modes/#native) apps. SkipFuseUI uses [SkipUI](https://skip.tools/docs/modules/skip-ui/) under the hood to adapt the SwiftUI APIs to Compose.

Compiled SwiftUI on Android is a work in progress. Until it is ready, we recommend using a [transpiled UI module](/https://skip.tools/docs/modes/#transpiled). When native support is complete, you will be able to [migrate](https://skip.tools/docs/modes/#migration) to it from your transpiled SwiftUI.
